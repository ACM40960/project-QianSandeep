# Price Prediction of S&P 500

This project focuses on predicting the prices of the S&P 500 using different machine learning models. We experimented with three different models, each documented in separate Jupyter notebooks. The final model is presented in Model 3, which also includes detailed data analysis.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the prices of the S&P 500 index. We experimented with different features and models to determine the best approach for accurate predictions. After thorough analysis, we finalized the model that performed the best in terms of prediction accuracy.

## Notebooks

### Model 1
- **Description**: This notebook focuses on using the 'Adj Close' feature for prediction.
- **Number of Code Cells**: 13

### Model 2
- **Description**: This notebook explores why predicting the 'Adj Close' price may not be the best approach.
- **Number of Code Cells**: 15

### Model 3 (Final Model)
- **Description**: This is our final model, which includes comprehensive data analysis and the finalized prediction model.
- **Number of Code Cells**: 29

## Installation
To run the notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Additionally, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt




Usage
Clone the repository and open the notebooks using Jupyter:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/price-prediction-sp500.git
cd price-prediction-sp500
jupyter notebook
Run the notebooks in sequence, starting with Model 1, then Model 2, and finally Model 3, to understand the progression of the models and the final results.
